 * One implementation of the failure fingerprint, shared by everything that

 * its findings, and (later) the replay of the stored corpus. Two
 * implementations would mean the counts behind "how often does this happen"
 * are fiction, so callers import from here rather than writing their own
 * regexes.
 *
 * Redaction is the other half. A detail line carries whatever hermesc printed,
 * which is the user's own code: the first rejection seen in production named
 * the property `promotionRequestItemId`. Details travel to the server, into
 * issue lists and -- once the fix loop runs -- into public pull requests and CI
 * fixtures, so the identifiers are replaced by tokens *before* the report
 * leaves the machine. The local console keeps the unredacted text: that is
 * where the name is actually useful.
